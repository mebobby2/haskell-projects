--Thereâ€™s a GHC extension to patterns, called BangPatterns, which allows forcing the evaluation of some parts
--of the pattern. Concretely, you can write ! before any part of the pattern, and then when matching is tried
--against that pattern, the expression in that point will be evaluated up to a constructor and then the match
--will be tried. For example, you can write a function that adds all the years from a list of time machines,
--using this syntax both to force the addition of each step and to ensure that the year in each time machine
--is also evaluated (so the addition does not have a thunk as second argument):

sumYears :: [TimeMachine] -> Integer
sumYears xs = sumYears' xs 0
              where sumYears' []            z = z
                    sumYears' (TM _ !y :ys) z = let !s = z + y in sumYears' ys s
